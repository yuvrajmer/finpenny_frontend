    mainSubTitle: "Build Wealth Through Disciplined Investing",
    mainDescription: `A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is one of the simplest and most effective ways to build long-term wealth through mutual funds. Instead of investing a large amount at once, SIP allows you to invest a fixed amount regularly—usually monthly—making investing more manageable and disciplined.

    At Finpenny, we help investors design structured SIP plans aligned with their income, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Our focus is to help you build consistent investing habits so that small monthly investments can grow into significant wealth over time.

    Whether you are starting your first investment or planning for future financial goals, SIP planning helps you stay consistent and benefit from the power of compounding.`,
